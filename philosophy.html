                    Metaphor: Seeds one day will beget more seeds.

                <p>
                    Teachers are those that have gone before. Teachers are raising the next generation and are therefore helping students in their progression. We can't really determine where we're planted, but we can choose in which direction we grow. Plants naturally grow toward the sun in order to produce energy and grow stronger. We have the goal of reaching our Heavenly Father. We need to focus our growth on the things that will enable us to get to him. One day, those efforts will bear results. We affect the lives of others on our own path. Trees have seeds that fall and find their own place to start their own journey. Those seeds will eventually grow to be their own trees.
